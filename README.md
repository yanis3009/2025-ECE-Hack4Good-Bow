**Welcome to the Hack4Good 2025 with ECE Paris !**

</div>

**As part of this hackathon, the theme is Crypto for Good. You are free to develop a project around this topic and to unleash your creativity by approaching it in an original and meaningful way.**

### Crypto for Good

This track encourages creating blockchain solutions for the greater good, financial inclusion, humanitarian aid, climate resilience, and supply chain transparency.
Here are some project examples :

- Financial Inclusion: payments, savings, and transfers accessible to the unbanked, even through SMS or WhatsApp, without the need for a smartphone or bank account.

- Humanitarian Aid: transparent, traceable donation collection and aid distribution systems powered by blockchain.

- Climate Resilience: blockchain-based climate data tracking, carbon credits, or decentralized energy projects.

- Humanitarian Supply Chain: standardization and traceability of products like RUTF bars, from manufacturing to the child beneficiary, with verifiable proof of delivery and stablecoin funding.

**A workshop will introduce you to the basics of the XRPL, including creating transactions, using MPTokens, and setting up Escrows, to help you effectively develop your project.**

### Workshop 1 *(Saturday 11:00AM - 11:30AM)*

> How to build on the XRPLedger? 
An overview of how it works, getting started, creating a wallet, making your first transaction, as well as concepts of Transaction, MPToken, and Escrow.

---

### Submission requirements


- A link to your repository, which must be publicly accessible.

- A short text presenting the main idea of your project: what it is about, what its objective is, and addressing the following questions:

> What real-world problem does your project aim to solve? Why is it important?

> How can your solution scale beyond the hackathon? Does it have the potential for broader adoption?

> Specify the XRPL features used. Does your project effectively leverage XRPL’s blockchain capabilities?

> Estimate the potential volume of real-world transactions your solution could generate on the XRPL.

- A link to a video or screenshots showcasing your solution.

#### XRPL Network Requirements
- Build on the XRPL Testnet.
- All projects must submit transactions to the L1.
- Using a sidechain such as [Xahau](https://xahau.network/) or the [XRPL EVM Sidechain](https://docs.xrplevm.org/) is allowed, but it may cost you a few points in the final scoring.


#### **🚨 Make sure to submit everything on [Hackathon App](https://hackathons.xrpl-commons.org/hackathons/68fb49c269f2ad67aa46f11b) before Sunday at 12:00 PM! 🚨**

### Judging criteria

Project evaluation will be based on four main criteria, each carrying equal weight in the final score :

- **Idea** (the originality of the concept)
- **Implementation** (the quality of the code and robustness of the architecture)
- **Demo** (how clearly you present your solution to the user)
- **Potential** (the total value transacted on-chain, the business model, and the potential to turn your project into a product)
